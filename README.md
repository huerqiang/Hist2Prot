Histo2Prot: Single-Cell Spatial Profiling of the Tumor Microenvironment from Histology Using Deep Learning

Histo2Prot is a deep learning framework for inferring single-cell–resolved spatial proteomic profiles from routine whole-slide histopathology (H&E) images.
The method integrates cell-level morphology, cell–cell spatial topology, and multi-task learning to reconstruct protein expression landscapes across the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Data Preparation

Input Data

Histo2Prot assumes the following inputs:

Whole-slide H&E images

Precomputed cell/nuclei segmentation results

Stored as .npy files

Each file contains instance-level cell masks

Single-cell protein expression matrix

Used as regression targets during training

Note
Cell segmentation is performed externally (e.g., HoVerNet).
Histo2Prot does not include segmentation inference, and directly reads segmentation results.


Quality Control (QC)  

The preprocessing pipeline follows these steps:

H&E staining performed on the same tissue section as molecular profiling

Color normalization to reduce batch/staining variability

Automatic tissue detection on whole-slide images

Tiling into non-overlapping 20× patches

Exclusion of:

Background-dominated tiles

Low-information regions

The resulting paired H&E patches + single-cell protein profiles form the final dataset.


Training  
Step 1: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Pan-cancer Virtual Spatial Proteomics of Single-cell Tumor Microenvironment from Histology

This repository provides the official implementation of **Hist2Prot**, an AI-enabled virtual spatial proteomics framework that computationally reconstructs **single-cell–resolved spatial protein expression profiles** directly from standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histopathology slides.

Hist2Prot integrates **cell-level morphological representations**, **cell–cell spatial topology**, and **multi-task learning** to infer high-dimensional protein expression landscapes across the tumor microenvironment (TME).

##📦 Data Preparation
Input Data

Whole-slide H&E images

Cell / nuclei segmentation results

Precomputed externally

Stored as .npy files

Each file contains instance-level cell masks

Single-cell protein expression matrix

Used as regression targets during training

Note

Cell segmentation is performed using HoVerNet

Hist2Prot does not include a segmentation inference module

Segmentation results are directly consumed as input

##🧪 Quality Control and Preprocessing

H&E staining:

Performed on the same tissue section as molecular profiling

Image normalization:

Color normalization applied to reduce staining variability

Tissue processing:

Automatic tissue detection on whole-slide images

Tiling into non-overlapping 20× patches

Tile filtering:

Removal of background-dominated tiles

Exclusion of low-information or artifact-prone regions

Final dataset:

Paired H&E patches

Corresponding single-cell protein expression profiles
